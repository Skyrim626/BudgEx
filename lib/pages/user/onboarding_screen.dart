/*
  Flutter Developer Notes:

  This Dart class represents an onboarding screen that guides users through key features of 
  the BudgEx application using a series of introductory pages. It includes animations, titles, 
  and subtitles to provide an engaging and informative user experience.

  Key Components:
  - A PageView displaying multiple IntroPage widgets, each representing a distinct feature.
  - PageController to track the current page and handle page changes.
  - A dot indicator for visualizing the current onboarding page.
  - Navigation options such as 'Skip,' 'Next,' and 'Done' for user interaction.

  Note: Ensure that the animations and content of each IntroPage are correctly specified. 
  Verify that the navigation to the Login page is functioning as expected after completing 
  the onboarding.

  Exceptional work on creating an onboarding experience that effectively introduces users to 
  the core features of BudgEx!
